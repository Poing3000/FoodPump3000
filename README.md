The Food Pump 3000 is a pump to feed cats automatically.
This food pump can be used on its own; however, it is actually part of the [Purr Pleaser 3000](https://github.com/Poing3000/PurrPleaser3000), a fully automatic cat feeding machine (for multiple cats).

Note that the code has been written for use with a Raspberry Pico W and can be used with the Arduino IDE.
