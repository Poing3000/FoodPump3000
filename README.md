The Food Pump 3000 is a automatic cat food pump, intended to be used for automatically feeding cats.
This food pump can be used on its own; however, it is actually part of the [Purr Pleaser 3000](https://github.com/Poing3000/PurrPleaser3000), a fully automatic cat feeding machine (for multiple cats).

Note, the code has been written for use with a Rapsberry Pico W and can simply be used with the Arduino IDE.
